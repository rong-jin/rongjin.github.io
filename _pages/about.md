My research focuses on three primary areas: Dynamics: Focus on precise, cost-effective modeling, both model- and data-based, to optimally analyze multi-body dynamical systems. Controls: Study advanced control techniques for deployable multi-body dynamical systems and robots. Passive control stabilizes dynamical systems against disturbances and uncertainties, while active control focuses on robust and precise control laws and path planning to reduce control energy and sensor and actuator costs while maintaining performance. Aerospace Systems: Design lightweight, deployable, automated aerospace systems to minimize costs and volume.
